== Code Quality
- Merge FoldR and FoldL reverse semantics into one reducing redundant code.

== TidyUp
- Would a FreeContext reduce variable mistreatment bugs in the future? An AlphaTuple would have a FreeContext, 
  and if other AlphaTuples want to share its context they'd need to be created through its method
  .InSameContext((name, value),...,(mame,value)) : AlphaTuple
- Collate observables in test results into a single row in table.
- Test results measurements last one should be in main directory. Also in a historical Json data file.
